Lets modify the V2 permission system specifications in the the following way:

1) All resource permissions are scoped to specific entities of Plant, Area, Sector.
1a) Permission inheritance: Sectors inherit from the Area from which they belong. And Areas inherit from the Plant to which they belong.

2) The only global scope that remains is the plant.create as Plant Manager role can create new plants.
2a) When a plant manager creates a new plant that user is automatically assigned permission for that entity.
2b) Area Manager role has area.create permission but that permission is restrictied to the specific Plant entity which they are assigned to.

3) Shifts, Asset Types, or Manufacturers entities that are shared between Plants, Areas, Sector (via Assets) must be validated before update or deletion:
3a) User can only update the shared entity if all associated Assets are in Plant, Areas or Sectors to which the user has permissions
3b) If the validation fails the system should provide only the option to create a copy and apply to the assets with permission
3c) UI: Use the Shift check modal as a model for this update validation / copy to new entity and apply.

4) Combine Super Administrator with Administrator while preserving system integrity.
4a) Preserve service-layer checks to maintain at least one administrator
4b) Only Adminstrators can assign Adminstrator role
4c) Ensure critical permissions stay with the administrator role
4d) Use audit logging for administrator role assignments

5) Remove all Form permissions as they are controlled by Routines (and other models in the future like Quality Inspections) which already have permissions.

6) Remove permissions to Reports. Reports should inherit permissions from Routine execution.
