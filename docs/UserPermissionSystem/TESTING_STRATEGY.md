# User Permission System Testing Strategy

## 1. Test Structure & Organization

### Feature-Based Test Suites
- Organize tests by feature modules (Plants, Areas, Sectors, Assets, Users, etc.)
- Separate unit tests from integration tests
- Create dedicated test suites for permission inheritance, cascading, and dynamic generation

### Test Data Management
- Use factories with trait variations for different permission scenarios
- Create seeder classes specifically for test data
- Implement test helpers for common permission setup patterns

## 2. Core Permission Mechanics Testing

### Dynamic Permission Generation
- Test that creating entities automatically generates the correct permissions
- Verify permission naming conventions are enforced
- Test edge cases like very long entity names or special characters
- Ensure permissions are created in the correct format (`resource.action.scope.id`)

### Permission Deletion Cascade
- Test that deleting entities removes all associated permissions
- Verify orphaned permissions are cleaned up
- Test cascade behavior through the entire hierarchy (Plant → Area → Sector → Asset)

### Hierarchy & Inheritance
- Test that plant-level permissions grant access to all child entities
- Verify area-level permissions work correctly for sectors and assets
- Test sector-level permissions for assets
- Ensure inheritance doesn't "leak" to sibling entities

## 3. Critical Edge Cases

### Administrator Protection
- Test that the system prevents deletion of the last administrator
- Verify administrator role assignment requires administrator privileges
- Test wildcard permission matching performance

### Shared Entity Validation
- Test update/delete operations on Shifts, Asset Types, and Manufacturers
- Verify validation checks all affected assets
- Test the "create copy" fallback mechanism

### Invitation System
- Test invitation scope restrictions (users can only grant permissions within their scope)
- Verify expired invitations are handled correctly
- Test invitation permission boundaries

## 4. Performance & Scalability Testing

### Load Testing
- Test permission checks with thousands of permissions per user
- Verify query performance with deep hierarchies
- Test bulk operations with large datasets

### Concurrent Operations
- Test simultaneous entity creation/deletion
- Verify no race conditions in permission generation
- Test cache invalidation under load

## 5. Security Testing

### Authorization Bypass Attempts
- Test direct API access without proper permissions
- Verify scope restrictions can't be circumvented
- Test permission elevation attempts

### Data Isolation
- Verify users can't access data outside their permission scope
- Test cross-plant data access prevention
- Verify API responses don't leak unauthorized data

## 6. Integration Testing

### End-to-End Workflows
- Test complete user invitation flow with permission assignment
- Verify asset creation through the full hierarchy
- Test routine execution with proper permissions

### API Contract Testing
- Test all API endpoints respect permissions
- Verify consistent error responses for unauthorized access
- Test permission checks in batch operations

## 7. Regression Testing

### Migration Testing
- Test V1 to V2 migration scenarios
- Verify no permissions are lost during migration
- Test rollback scenarios

### Backward Compatibility
- Ensure existing integrations continue to work
- Test deprecated permission formats are handled gracefully

## 8. Testing Best Practices

### Isolation
- Each test should be independent
- Use database transactions for test isolation
- Mock external services (email, etc.)

### Assertions
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Verify not just the result but also the reason (audit logs)
- Check side effects (cache updates, event dispatching)

### Documentation
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Group related tests with clear descriptions
- Document complex test scenarios

### Maintenance
- Regular test refactoring to reduce duplication
- Keep test data factories up to date
- Monitor test execution time

## 9. Automated Testing Strategy

### Continuous Integration
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests on pull requests
- Schedule full test suite runs periodically

### Test Coverage
- Aim for high coverage of permission-related code
- Focus on critical paths rather than 100% coverage
- Use mutation testing to verify test quality

### Performance Benchmarks
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Alert on performance regressions
- Track permission check times over releases

## 10. Manual Testing Scenarios

While focusing on programmatic tests, some scenarios benefit from manual verification:

- Complex permission inheritance visualization
- User experience during permission denials
- Edge cases in the UI permission matrix
- Real-world workflow simulations

# Implementation Scope & Phases

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal**: Establish core testing infrastructure and critical path coverage

### Setup & Infrastructure
- Configure test database with transactional cleanup
- Set up factory patterns for all permission-related models
- Create test helper traits for common permission scenarios
- Establish naming conventions for test files and methods

### Critical Tests to Implement

#### Administrator Protection Suite
- Last administrator deletion prevention
- Administrator role assignment authorization
- First user becomes administrator

#### Dynamic Permission Generation
- Permission creation on entity creation
- Permission naming format validation
- Permission cleanup on entity deletion

#### Basic Authorization Checks
- Simple CRUD operations with permissions
- Permission denial scenarios
- Administrator bypass verification

## Phase 2: Hierarchy & Inheritance (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal**: Ensure hierarchical permissions work correctly

### Test Suites to Build

#### Cascade Permission Tests
- Plant → Area → Sector → Asset inheritance
- Sibling isolation (Area A can't access Area B)
- Mixed permission levels (Plant view + Sector manage)

#### Entity-Scoped Permissions
- Create operations at each hierarchy level
- ViewAny permissions with proper scoping
- Cross-hierarchy permission validation

#### Bulk Operations
- Import with permission validation
- Export respecting view permissions
- Batch operations with mixed permissions

## Phase 3: Complex Scenarios (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal**: Cover edge cases and complex workflows

### Advanced Test Coverage

#### Shared Entity Validation
- Shift updates affecting multiple plants
- Asset Type modifications with permission checks
- Copy creation for partial permissions

#### Invitation System
- Scoped invitation permissions
- Permission boundary enforcement
- Invitation expiration and revocation

#### Asset & Routine Integration
- Routine management through asset permissions
- Execution permissions validation
- Export permissions including routine data

## Phase 4: Performance & Security (Week 7)

**Goal**: Ensure system performs well and is secure

### Performance Tests

#### Load Testing Suite
- 10,000+ permissions per user
- Deep hierarchy traversal (10+ levels)
- Concurrent permission checks

#### Query Optimization Verification
- Database query counting
- N+1 query detection
- Cache hit rate validation

### Security Tests

#### Authorization Bypass Attempts
- Direct API manipulation

- Permission escalation scenarios

## Phase 5: Integration & UI (Week 8)

**Goal**: Full system integration testing

### End-to-End Tests

#### Complete Workflows
- User invitation → assignment → work execution
- Entity creation through full hierarchy
- Report generation with permissions

#### API Contract Tests
- All endpoints respect permissions
- Consistent error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes

# Implementation Steps

## Step 1: Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Configure test database
php artisan config:cache --env=testing
php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing --seed
```

## Step 2: Create Base Test Classes
```php
// Base test class with permission helpers
abstract class PermissionTestCase extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase, MocksInvitations;
    
    // Common permission test helpers
}
```

## Step 3: Factory Development
```php
// Enhanced factories for permission scenarios
UserFactory::new()->withPlantPermissions($plant)
AssetFactory::new()->withUserAccess($user)
// Include all necessary relationships
```

## Step 4: Incremental Test Development
- Start with most critical scenarios
- Build up complexity gradually
- Refactor common patterns into helpers

## Step 5: CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Permission Tests
  run: php artisan test --filter=Permission
# Include performance regression notifications
```
