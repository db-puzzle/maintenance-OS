## Commands to Verify

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npm run types

# Check ESLint
npm run lint

# Check security
npm audit

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Next Steps

1. **Optional Type Safety Improvements** (2-3 days)
   - Replace remaining 98 `any` types
   - Follow the TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDE.md

2. **PHP/Laravel Analysis** (1 day)
   - Install composer dependencies
   - Run Laravel Pint
   - Configure PHPStan

3. **CI/CD Setup** (1 day)
   - Add automated linting to pipeline
